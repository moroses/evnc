# evnc: vnc server manager

This is a homebrew VNC server manager, for multiple users with an easy to set config file per user.

## Config file scheme

The config file needs to be in the user's home folder named `.evnc`.

Default appearence of the config file for now:
```
VNC_NUMBER={0-99};
VNC_RES_HOR={Number};
VNC_RES_VER={Number};
```
That is all for now.
